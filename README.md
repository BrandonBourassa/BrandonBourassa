## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Brandon Bourassa. I got my B.S. in Oceanic and Atmospheric Science and am currently pursuing my masters in Weather and Climate Risk and Data Analytics. My career and reserach interests lie at the intersection of climate change and extreme weather. More specifically, how extreme weather will be changed in a warmer world. When I am not involved with weather models and staring at the rain I enjoy playing basketball (Go Lakers!), watching movies, and spending time at Disneyland with my family!
